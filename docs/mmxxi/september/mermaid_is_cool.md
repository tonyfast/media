# like hearing an old song again

its 2021, ten years since the 2020 blip, and 7 years since i first wrote about mermaid diagrams in 2014. i recently rediscovered mermaid while learning just how many great features hackmd provides. i've been having fun exploring all of mermaid's modern features in work collaboratively with my friends. we're all having fun with mermaid, its like hearing an old song for the time.

```mermaid
gantt
    mermaid :0d, 1d
    is :1d, 2d
    cool :1d
```

## diagrams with mermaid

you can explore the hackmd docs for all the cool extras they provide. we're just going to focus on mermaid.

## can mermaid jupyter?

before our blip, the homie @bollwyvl had a `%%mermaid` magic that worked in the classic notebok. those were simpler times, and now we have `jupyterlab`, `mermaid` magic has been archived.

the new school does provide a cool `jupyter-markup` extension adds code fence directives like mermaid. some examples are show in the screenshots below.

TODO: screenshots

## conclusion

mermaid is cool. markdown is cool. jupyter is cool. hackmd is cool. it is cool that they are all cool with each other. stay cool.
