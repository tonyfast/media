# submitting new media

currently, we normalize writing every document in markdown. with markdown our design language we encourage using hackmd for review.

> __prompt__ write a document with other editting workflows like liveshare or duckly.

## what you'll need

to start we require some content written in markdown. it is best if this content is submitted this [pull request template]().

use this issue template if you have questions about the submission process, or want someone to help you with a pull request.

## what to expect

after you submit your content you will be assigned an editor with xx business days. they will contact you and provide initial feedback on your draft. your editor will then guide you through the [review](review.md) 

### in case of emergency

_we'll need a policy for a backlog._
